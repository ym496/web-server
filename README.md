# minimal http server in java
This is a lightweight multi-threaded HTTP server built from scratch using Java. It can handle GET, POST, and other HTTP requests asynchronously. It supports HTTP methods and serves files from a specified directory. It can process multiple requests at the same time by leveraging Javaâ€™s threading mechanism. I created this to understand how HTTP servers work.

## demo
* serves files with different MIME type from a specified dir

*  this server uses Java threads to handle client requests concurrently. Each client request is processed in its own thread, ensuring non-blocking, simultaneous processing of multiple requests.
